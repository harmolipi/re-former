# Chess
Created as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) Ruby on Rails curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/re-former).

### Functionality

This is part of the [Forms Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/forms) project, which works through creating some example forms, first with pure HTML, and then with progressively more of it handled by Rails helper methods.

### Thoughts

Tbd...

God bless.
